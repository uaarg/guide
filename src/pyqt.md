# PyQt6

We use PyQt6 for the pigeon GUI.

[Python GUIs](https://www.pythonguis.com/topics/pyqt6/) has a great tutorial
for learning PyQt6. Qt themselves also have a great [get started
guide](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/quickstart.html#quick-start).

There is also, of course, the [official PyQt6
docs](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/). I highly recommend using the search
feature of the official docs. Qt is a massive library, it takes some time to
discover it's many features.
