A collection of scripts running on the drone or for determining drone flight plans. These preform both imaging and autopilot tasks. 

Repository: [github.com/uaarg/shepard](https://github.com/uaarg/shepard).

## Getting Started

Shepard has a [setup guide](https://github.com/uaarg/shepard#how-do-i-get-set-up) in it's README.

> NOTE: Many of shepard's features are meant to be running on the onboard
> raspberry pi. The project should still be able to run on your machine, but it
> may have to stub out components such as the camera.
